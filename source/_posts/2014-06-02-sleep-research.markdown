I'm currently doing a systematic study of human sleep. It's shocking how little
attention is devoted to the topic given that it occupies such a dominant place
in all our lives. I'm not going to rattle on about how our mental performance
when we're awake is tied to the quality of sleep. There are lots of books and
blog posts dedicated to it.

What triggered the latest interest in sleep? I finished a seven month stint
where I experimented with [Everyman
sleep](http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/everyman/)
with a four and half hour core sleep
period. It meant that I got by on a little more than five hours of sleep every
day including the two twenty minute naps. There are some interesting
observations and conclusions that I'd want
to share here. But I felt I'd be able to interpret the experience better
if I went through some existing literature first.

This is my study list for now:

1. Claudio Stampi's book [Why We
   Nap](http://www.amazon.com/Why-we-nap-STAMPI/dp/0817634622/?tag=gajspersit-20)
2. Supermemo on Sleep:
    * [Sleep in
    general](http://www.supermemo.com/articles/sleep.htm)
    * [Polyphasic](http://www.supermemo.com/articles/polyphasic.htm#Benjamin Franklin)
    * [FAQ](http://www.supermemo.com/help/faq/polyphasic.htm#7657-5556)
    * [Formula for Healthy
   Sleep](http://www.supermemo.com/articles/sleepchart.htm)
3. William Dement's book [Promise of
   Sleep](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0440509017/?tag=gajspersit-20)

I want to find an online copy of Nathaniel Kleitman's 1939 book _Sleep and
Wakefulness_, but so far I've been unsuccessful.
[Kleitman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Kleitman)'s considered the
father of modern sleep research.
